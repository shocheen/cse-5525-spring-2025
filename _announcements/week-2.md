The instructions for assignment 1 have been updated to include information on how to submit. They can be accessed [here]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/assignment1/CSE_5525_Assignment_1.pdf).

The code and dataset remain the same and can be downloaded [here]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/assignment1/p1-distrib.zip)

All submissions will have to be made to gradescope. Remember to include your report as .pdf in the same zip as your project. Be careful to select and zip all files/folders and not the directory containing your entire project as it may cause issues in the autograder.

We have added all of you to this course on gradescope. Everyone should have received an enrollment notification. If you didn't, please let us know.

All the best for your first homework!
