## Introduction

This is an in-person course. Most course activities and resources can be found through our
course website on Carmen.
There will be weekly quizzes, to be completed during the Friday class. The expectation is that
you will attend in person. If you cannot, the quizzes will be available for remote completion
during class time. If circumstances prevent you from completing the quiz at that time, contact
me to arrange an accommodation.
Wednesday classes (except January 10th and 17th) will include up to 40 minutes work on
projects. You should come to class ready to discuss project plans with your group. If the majority
of your group is unable to attend on a particular Wednesday, you should ask me for permission
to meet virtually.
The final two classes of the course will be dedicated to presentations by project groups. These
will be virtual for all groups.
There will be a mid-term exam and a final exam.
Important Note: This syllabus, along with course assignments and due dates, are subject to
change. It is the student’s responsibility to check our course Carmen site for corrections or
updates to the syllabus. Any changes will be clearly noted in course announcements.

* The course requirements include project work (including group projects). The milestones for this work will include submitting a written project proposal, a mid term project report, a final oral presentation and a written report.
